PHP-Validate
============

PHP parameter/array validation library. Similar to Params::Validate for Perl.

Requires PHP 5.3 or higher (due to usage of namespaces and closures).

All the classes contain PHP-doc documentation, so for now, take a look at the code of Validator.class.php or one of the test/example scripts in the t subdirectory.
